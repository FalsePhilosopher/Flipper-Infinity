# Flipper-Infinity

I slightly modified Equipter's ClassicConverter https://github.com/equipter/ClassicConverter [7B_Converter.py](/Scripts/7B_Converter.py) for the conversion.  
Run [infsha.py](/Scripts/infsha.py)`python3 infsha.py UID` to get the key A  
Edit the desired NFC file with the key A in these spots  
![Key A](Images/KeyA.png)  
Transfer file to FZ and emulate.
